# Soundboard

A GUI soundboard application template

## Description

Soundboard is a JavaFX GUI application that allows the user to play sounds by clicking buttons.
This package comes with one sample audio file and one button. It is intended to be a template for
creating your own soundboard.

## How to Extend

To get started, open the .fxml layout file and add more buttons similar to the existing button. Define the callback
functions and then implement those functions in the controller. The controller has a sample function that can be
cloned to play different sounds or handle other actions.

## Building and Running

With JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, create a new project from this existing source.
 
Run the application by first creating a run configuration by going to Run -> Edit Configurations. From there,
click the green plus(+) icon and select Application. Change the Name field to something convenient. 
Set the main class to use soundboard.Main. Save the configuration by clicking OK, and then run with Shift+F10.
